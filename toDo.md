# ToDo:

Use the empty space on the sides of the homepage by having one column be write reviews and the other column list existing reviews. (Haram)

Site color scheme (Parmbir, Patrick)

## Not Priority

Display two most recent reviews. A conditional for if more than 2 reviews only display random 2?

Pick a Google font for website.

## For Future Development

Instead of writing reviews on the profile page give the user the ability to edit their existing reviews (this might be the most labor intensive).

Add a dropdown menu when creating a new review that gives the image a score out of ten.

Filter more memes and have NSFW and Spoiler filter enabled.
