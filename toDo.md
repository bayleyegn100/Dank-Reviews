# ToDo:

Link reddit review images to homepage

Once review submits save image to the database IF it's not already saved there. Validate it by the API's ID.

Create image model with id and image URL. (Parm, Mike, Patrick, Jason)

store image url once a review is submitted. 

Homepage needs review box centered (Jesse)

Use the empty space on the sides of the homepage by having one column be write reviews and the other column list existing reviews.

Create a modal that opens when you click on a thumbnail image of a meme in the profile that shows the full meme.

Instead of writing reviews on the profile page give the user the ability to edit their existing reviews (this might be the most labor intensive).

Add a dropdown menu when creating a new review that gives the image a score out of ten.

## Not Priority

Display two most recent reviews. A conditional for if more than 2 reviews only display random 2?

Pick a Google font for website.
